# Use Tomorrow Units
Make use of New Horizon units.

<br>

**Notes:**

This mod basically gives you easy access to some of the units from the New Horizon mod.

<br>

There is no need to research any of these units on the Tech Tree. They are all unlocked by default.

<br>

This mod provides 1 factory building, so that you can build (and use) the units. {No reconstructor blocks are necessary.}

<br>

This mod can be used in the campaign, to get an extra boost of units, which are stronger than the vanilla in-game units.

<br>

I made this small mod, because I wanted to play with the New Horizon units, but I did not want to spend hours and days gathering and manufacturing all the required resources (items), in order to unlock all the components of New Horizon on the Tech Tree.

<br>

This mod has the New Horizon mod as a dependency.

<br>

I hope you enjoy this mod, and have fun with it.
